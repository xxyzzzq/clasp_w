INTRODUCTION
---------------
Clasp_W is a modified version of the Clasp solver.
This distribution package is modified based on clasp-2.0.6.
It provides a window mechanism for stopping the solver
earlier when a relatively good solution is found.

For detailed information of Clasp, please look at
http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/clasp/

The Linux binaries is built on Ubuntu 11.10, please use
"ldd" to check whether the shared libraries are linked correctly.

USAGE
---------------
clasp_w [options] [input-file]

Clasp_W takes an input file which must conforms to the standard
PB solver requirements (ref. http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB09/solver_req.html)
If no input file is specified, Clasp_W will take input from the standard
input (Ctrl-D for EOF for Linux, and Ctrl-Z for Windows).

Options:
  -w default|<a>,<b>,<c>
    This option is only works when an objective function exists.
    If not, it taks no effect.
    
    By default, the -w option is not specified, the solver will
    terminate until the optimum solution is found.
    
    However, sometimes the user may want the solver to terminate
    earlier when it has already found a good solution. Clasp_W
    provides a window mechanism for early termination. Typically,
    the diagram of the best objective function to the time is like
    the following:

    |                       /               |

    |         /    |                        |
    |       -      |                        |
    |      /       |                        |

    |  /           |                        |

    | /            |                        |
    |/             |                        |
    ____________________________________________ time
                  x1                       x2

    We want to terminate when the solver begins to find new solutions
    very slow. The window mechanism is like this:
      Suppose the current time & best value are x2,y2, and the time &
      best value at an previous time point are x1,y1. Here we fix the
      ratio of x1 to x2. If y1>d*y2, then we can judge the solver is
      entering the hard zone, and it will stop.
    
    The four parameters a,b,c respectively stands for:
      a:  Minimum timeout. The window mechanism will not work until the
          solving time is greater than a (in milliseconds).
      b:  The ratio of window size to x2, i.e. (x2-x1)/x2. Note that
          when x2 becomes large, (x2-x1) will increase too, and (x2-x1)
          should not be greater than b.
      c:  The ratio of x1 to x2, i.e. x1/x2.
  
  -s <value>
    This option can be used with -w option. This is to specify the start
    value point. The value passed to the window is the difference of <value>
    and the current best value. (negative differences will be considered
    as zero)
